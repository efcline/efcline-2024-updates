				<p> 
The Georgia Tech Library in Atlanta, GA is hosting the inaugural <strong>Southeast Data Librarian Symposium on October 8-9, 2018.</strong></P>
 <p>
This symposium is styled after the successful and popular Midwest Data Librarian Symposium, being held this year on the same date. 
 </P><p>
As such, it is intended to provide similar low-cost networking and educational opportunities for librarians supporting research data management in the Southeastern United States.  
 </P><p>
A planning committee of librarians from Duke, Emory, Florida State, Georgia State, Georgia Tech, and the University of Virginia are responsible for developing the program and organizing symposium events. Topics covered may include data visualization; data sharing and re-use; data curation and preservation; and data literacy.
 </P><p>
Stay tuned for additional information and announcements. Questions should be directed to <a href="mailto:se.datalibrarian@gmail.com">se.datalibrarian@gmail.com</a></p>
