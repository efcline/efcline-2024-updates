		<h2>About:</h2>
		<p>The Southeast Data Librarian Symposium is intended to provide a low-cost opportunity for librarians and other research data specialists to gather and explore developments in the field of data librarianship, including the management and sharing of research data. Check out the past symposium websites below for an idea of programming content.</p>
		<p>In addition to learning about new work in the field, attendees will have the opportunity to network and build partnerships with regional colleagues. It is open to all who wish to attend, including students, data managers and scientists, and those situated outside the Southeast. The meeting is styled after the successful <a href="https://mwdatalibrariansymposium.wordpress.com/">Midwest Data Librarian Symposium</a>.</p>
