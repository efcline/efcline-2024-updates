1,"Wed, Oct 13",w3_wed,90,1:00 PM,2:30 PM,Workshops,Tips for Effective Data Visualization,Eric Monson (Duke University),"Visualization is a powerful way to reveal patterns in data, attract attention, and get your message across to an audience quickly and clearly. But, there are many steps in that journey from exploration to information to influence, and many choices to make when putting it all together to tell your story. I will cover some basic guidelines for effective visualization, point out a few common pitfalls to avoid, and run through a critique and iterations of an existing visualization to help you start seeing better choices beyond the program defaults.",,
1,"Wed, Oct 13",w3_wed,90,1:00 PM,2:30 PM,Workshops,Data Management Planning with DMPTool,"Jo Klein (University of North Carolina Greensboro), Nina Exner (Virginia Commonwealth University), Lindsay Gypin (University of North Carolina Greensboro)","Is your library starting to offer data management plan services? Does thinking about helping a researcher with their data management plan give you nightmares? Helping researchers write a data management plan (DMP) is an essential service that data librarians may be asked to provide. DMPs are required for many funded research studies, but they are often not intuitive. New data librarians may want to know: what information goes into a plan, what do the section headers mean, and how do plans differ across disciplines? DMPTool (https://dmptool.org) is here to help! DMPTool is one of the most commonly used, freely available tools for writing a plan, with templates and resources to help guide researchers through the planning process. In this workshop, three data librarians will demonstrate how to use DMPTool and answer the questions that keep you up at night, through a simple exercise to explore what information might go in a DMP and how DMPTool’s built-in templates can help a data librarian step through data management interviews with researchers. At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to (1) access DMPTool; (2) select a DMP template based on a funding agency; and (3) provide an example of which information might go in the most common sections of a plan.",,

H. Barrett (Seton Hall University)","ArcGIS is one of the most popular story-telling tools which has been used to integrate interactive multimedia, maps, and text. In this workshop, we will train the audience on how to use ArcGIS StoryMaps step-by-step to create their own StoryMap. In our presentation, we will use an example created and dispensed by our Data Services Team for marketing and outreach initiatives on the Seton Hall University campus. Participants will be able to create customized express maps for buildings and roads in addition to integrating videos and/or posts from social media. ",,

This workshop will show you how to use free and open source tools to access data from the Crossref publication data API. We will review the features of Crossref as a data source, walk through the two Python libraries you’ll need to access the API (Pandas and Requests), and talk about different freely available visualization software including Microsoft Power BI and Google Data Studio. We will code together in real time using Google Colab Jupyter Notebooks and leave you with example code that you can begin modifying to pull data relevant to your institution.",,
