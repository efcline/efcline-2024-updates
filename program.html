Over the past year, two labor economics liaison librarians at peer institutions have collaborated to create data-literacy-focused instructional resources that satisfy the needs of both of their constituents. Challenges faced included different curricular requirements, despite the similar subject matter, differing database subscriptions at each institution, and dissimilar accessibility requirements for online instructional resources such as LibGuides. This poster will discuss the steps taken to create a resource that was useful for both libraries, and how those resources addressed the learning objectives at each institution, as well as provide attendees with suggestions of considerations when starting their own cross-institutional data-focused collaborative projects.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to identify potential ways to start a cross-library collaboration at peer institutions. <li>Attendees will be able to identify solutions to challenges within cross-institutional collaboration. <li>Attendees will be able to describe ways in which co-created resources may be adapted to suit learning objectives at different institutions.</ul></div>
<br /><br /><strong>Data Skills Taught on Campus: Review of Course Description and Curriculum</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Jingjing Wu (Texas Tech University)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">Since Spring 2021, our library has offered an R workshop for beginners. We saw a comparatively higher registration; People who registered for the workshop came from various academic background such as education, engineering, and business; Most attendees were graduate students. How are data skills taught on campus? How can our workshops better support the teaching and learning process? To answer these questions, I searched the keyword "data" in the course title and description of the Course Catalog 2022-2023 and identified over 200 classes as data-related courses. I reviewed the course description and curriculum to find data skills and tools covered in these courses. This presentation aims to present the distributions of data-related courses at our university and analyze the data skills and tools used in these classes.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> Learn how data-related courses are distributed by subject area and academic classification. <li> Learn what data skills and tools are covered in these courses. <li> Be able to apply the similar research at their own institution if interested.</ul></div>
<br /><br /><strong>Defining Data, Data Services, and Data Librarianship Through Job Ad Analysis</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Jessica Hagman (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)<li> Michelle Reed (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)<li> Monica Carroll (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">Job advertisements serve multiple functions; in addition to inviting applications, they also communicate a library's organizational goals, values, and understanding of its own role in the broader campus and scholarly environment. In a call for a data librarian, we can find language that defines how the library sees data and data services as they describe the organization, the need for the position, and the hoped-for qualifications of the successful applicant.<br /><br />In this presentation, we share the results of a mixed-methods analysis of data-related positions on the ALA JobLIST from 2008-2019. Our analysis shows trends in the number and location of positions over time, as well as themes in how data and data services are defined. We will invite attendees &mdash; particularly those involved in hiring data librarians &mdash; to assess example advertisements to consider how the choice of language may ultimately shape decisions by potential applicants.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Knowledge of trends in data-related job advertisements in libraries.<li>Strategies for assessing language in job advertisements to assess how language is used to define data and data services to potential applicants.</ul></div>

Riley (Georgia State University)<li> Ashley Rockwell (Georgia State University)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">In Spring 2022, Georgia State University Library's Research Data Services Department launched the GSU Data Ready! Badges data literacy micro-credentialing initiative: lib.gsu.edu/data-ready. In this poster session, we will present: (1) content of our two badges tracks &mdash; data literacy foundations and software/coding training [14 separate badges]; (2) online platforms [Canvas and Badgr] used for automated badge earning and distribution; (3) assessment of program success; and (4) ways in which other institutions might develop similar initiatives. <br /><br />The poster session format will optimize attendee engagement via extended Q&A and demonstration opportunities.<br /><br />This session should appeal to all data librarians, from beginning to experienced. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> Insight into how we structured our workshop content and learning assessments for badge earning. <li> A behind-the-scenes look at the online platforms used to create our badge initiative. <li> Successes and lessons learned from our implementation to inform improvements and potential models for other institutions.</ul></div>
<br /><br /><strong>Data isn't Neutral, So What is It? Standpoint Theory, Positionality, and Data in Context</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Sarah Webb Holsapple (Orange County, NC)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">This poster proposal seeks to address data sharing, positionality, and diversity in research.<br /><br />Researchers create data and share that data in university repositories. Once data is accessed, downloaded, and used in other research it loses context. Data is not neutral. To understand data, it's important to understand the standpoint from which it was collected.<br /><br />Standpoint Theory tells us that research perspectives are shaped by social position, and that knowledge (and data) is not objective but contextual. Positionality statements aim to place the research in the context of the researcher's social position.<br /><br />A data positionality statement written from the standpoint of the data would give context to the data itself &mdash; the who, what, where, and why. We can use the positionality statements to make this information more accessible (metadata). This context matters. We all want more diversity in research materials, but how do we get it and how do we find it? We have to label it. This work has implications for the reuse of data, machine learning/data science, and a bigger picture look at the context of all this data. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> How Standpoint Theory and positionality statements can impact research data. <li> Stir some thoughts about context, intersectionality, and diversity in research data and why it matters. <li> Ask questions about how we can/if we should label the diversity in research data this way.</ul></div></td></tr>

One of his most intriguing findings was that data-involved librarians are not as well versed in the programming and technical skills needed to support large-scale data services at their institutions. Whether due to limited professional resources or limited time, data-involved librarians often put their desire to learn programming skills in the back of their mind as they maintain their more time-sensitive duties. This workshop will introduce participants to Python, one of the most popular coding languages in use, and provide them with a roadmap to becoming more comfortable with programming. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Comfort with the basic principles and operations in Python.<li>Identify next steps for continuing their programming journey.</ul></div></td></tr>

Students from this program are typically adults returning to school while holding full-time jobs. For years, the education liaison librarian has spent a large proportion of time reviewing information literacy concepts individually with students at various levels of comfort re-orienting to research processes. In 2022, she created a self-enrollable instruction module connected to students' Canvas learning shells, and when a data librarian position was added into the library, the two librarians collaborated to integrate data literacy pages to the course. This session will introduce the topics covered in the module, review the process of integrating the Canvas module into the Educational Leadership program, provide some early assessment of how students took to the module, and suggest future steps for embedding this module for improving adult student success.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Apply ideas for how to create an asynchronous learning guide covering data literacy for graduate students. <li>Reproduce the outreach methods used to embed a module into a program or course. <li>Associate what sort of data and information literacy concepts education (or other social sciences) graduate students need help with.</ul></div>
<br /><br />10:20 AM<br /><strong>Designing a Webinar Series to Address the Data Literacy Needs of Beginning Researchers</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Talicia Tarver (Virginia Commonwealth University)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">The VCU Library system hosts regularly-scheduled webinars (called Online Workshops), through which all interested parties can register to learn how to use library resources for various research needs. Lately, the feedback from faculty was that graduate students could benefit from more pointed instruction on data literacy topics, including how to deconstruct a secondary data set record.<br /><br />In response to this feedback and the desire to create new workshops, the Health Sciences Library (HSL) created two new webinars to introduce the university's community to library resources that supported data and statistics queries. A "Finding Health Statistics Online" webinar was first piloted to call attention to library guides on online statistical resources and how to use them. Due to the success of this course, the HSL proposed a new course on finding secondary data resources and reviewing the structure of a sample dataset record. This webinar is scheduled to be presented in the fall and, so far, response to this offering has been positive. <br /><br />This presentation will discuss how the HSL developed these webinars and how these will be used to fill a data literacy gap for graduate students and beginning researchers. Once the webinar has been offered, participant feedback will be applied to determine how it can be further adapted to suit the audience's needs. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li> Identifying data literacy needs within a health sciences university population. <li> How to guide graduate students (and beginning researchers) to statistics and data resources.  <li> Using an existing teaching infrastructure (an existing webinar series) to help the target audience effectively use these resources for their own research.</ul></div>
<br /><br />10:40 AM<br /><strong>Creating New Data Reference Models Within Existing Library Support Structures</strong><ul class="vertical-list"><li>Whitney Kramer (Cornell University)</ul><button type="button" class="collapsible">Show/Hide Abstract</button><div class="content">How do you create a data-focused reference and instruction program that supports social science programs in a specific school within the larger university while also aligning your work with existing library and data services? In 2019, a liaison librarian at a R1 institution was tasked with creating a data reference and instruction program from scratch in order to support specific social science programs on campus. While there were existing data support services at other campus libraries, most were focused on the physical sciences, and the librarian's unit had never provided focused data services to its constituents. This talk will provide both new and established data librarians with an overview of the unique, ongoing challenges and opportunities in creating a social science-focused data reference and instruction program from scratch during the pandemic while also fitting it into pre-existing library offerings. Attendees can learn about creating services that are meaningful to your constituents while not reinventing the wheel of existing library services on campus. <br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will be able to identify opportunities for additional librarian-led data support at their own institutions. <li>Attendees will be able to understand how to create new data-focused services to serve undersupported programs at their own institutions. <li>Attendees will be able to describe ways in which existing library services can be adapted to support the data needs of different schools and departments.</ul></div></td></tr>

Librarians in small or under-resourced institutions often face challenges such as budget and personnel limitations or resistance from faculty as they work to create services. "Tools for RDS" was launched as a way to provide ideas and solutions in focused, interactive modules. It is intended to be an evergreen resource with inclusion of case studies, templates, tips and tricks provided by those who have had both failures and successes in their RDS journeys.<br /><br />The short talk will introduce participants to the Tools for RDS project. We will discuss our goals for this Open Resource, share our collaboration and creation process, and show participants the work that has been completed thus far in the Pressbooks platform.<br /><br />Additionally, following the short talk we will have time to solicit input and contributions from both novice and veteran data services librarians who might be interested in adding their voice to the project.<br /><br />Short Talk Activities: (1) discuss the need for this Tools for RDS project, and how we saw it as an opportunity to fill a gap in the available resources, (2) share information about the collaborative process we have used thus far to create Tools for RDS, (3) show the importance of illustrating principles and practices through the use of real and fictional case studies, (4) walk through the Pressbooks online publishing platform we are using to create Tools for RDS to participants, and (5) talk about our coming goals for the Tools for RDS project: how we would like to build it from here, what additional components would be most helpful, and how interested parties can contribute to it.<br /><br />Audience Input: (1) discuss three of the biggest challenges for launching or growing RDS programs, (2) brainstorm innovative approaches to the identified challenges using a variety of techniques such as mind mapping and popcorn ideation, (3) create and write up concrete actions that address the identified challenges for inclusion in "Tools for RDS", and (4) share information with attendees about how they can contribute to the Tools for RDS project.<br /><br /><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> <ul class="vertical-list"><li>Attendees will see how the Tools for RDS project has been created, and gain understanding of how this collaborative process has been used to produce a deliverable that fills a gap and addresses current needs. <li>Attendees will share their experiences launching research data services with colleagues. They will collaborate to build successful strategies that can be used at their own institutions. <li>Attendees will contribute to an open, online resource that will be used by librarians in the future as they implement research data services. <li>Attendees will have the opportunity to identify collaborators that they can work with in the future to create and implement programs or develop areas of research interest.</ul></div>
